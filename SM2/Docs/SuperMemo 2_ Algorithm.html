<p><font size="3">I wrote the first SuperMemo program in December 1987 (Turbo
Pascal 3.0, IBM PC). It was intended to enhance the SuperMemo method in two basic ways:</font>

</p><ol>
  <li><font size="3">apply the optimization procedures to smallest possible items
    (in the paper-based SuperMemo items were grouped in pages),</font></li>
  <li><font size="3">differentiate between the items on the base of their
    different difficulty.</font></li>
</ol>

<p><font size="3">Having observed that subsequent inter-repetition intervals
are increasing by an approximately constant factor (e.g. two in the case of the SM-0
algorithm for English vocabulary), I decided to apply the following formula to calculate
inter-repetition intervals:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">I(1):=1<br>
  I(2):=6<br>
  for n&gt;2 I(n):=I(n-1)*EF</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">where:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">I(n) - inter-repetition interval after the n-th repetition
  (in days)<br>
  EF - easiness factor reflecting the easiness of memorizing and retaining a given item in
  memory (later called the <a name="E-Factor">E-Factor</a>).</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">E-Factors were allowed to vary between 1.1 for the most
difficult items and 2.5 for the easiest ones. At the moment of introducing an item into a
SuperMemo database, its E-Factor was assumed to equal 2.5. In the course of repetitions
this value was gradually decreased in case of recall problems. Thus the greater problems
an item caused in recall, the more significant was the decrease of its E-Factor.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Shortly after the first SuperMemo program had been
implemented, I noticed that E-Factors should not fall below the value of 1.3. Items having
E-Factors lower than 1.3 were repeated annoyingly often and always seemed to have inherent
flaws in their formulation (usually they did not conform to the minimum information
principle). Thus not letting E-Factors fall below 1.3 substantially improved the
throughput of the process and provided an indicator of items that should be reformulated.
The formula used in calculating new E-Factors for items was constructed heuristically and
did not change much in the following 3.5 years of using the computer-based SuperMemo
method.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">In order to calculate the new value of an E-Factor, the
student has to assess the quality of his response to the question asked during the
repetition of an item (my SuperMemo programs use the 0-5 grade scale - the range
determined by the ergonomics of using the numeric key-pad). The general form of the
formula used was:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">EF':=f(EF,q)</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">where:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">EF' - new value of the E-Factor<br>
  EF - old value of the E-Factor<br>
  q - quality of the response<br>
  f - function used in calculating EF'.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The function f had initially multiplicative character and
was in later versions of SuperMemo program, when the interpretation of E-Factors changed
substantially, converted into an additive one without significant alteration of
dependencies between EF', EF and q. To simplify further considerations only the function f
in its latest shape is taken into account:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">EF':=EF-0.8+0.28*q-0.02*q*q</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">which is a reduced form of:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><font size="3">EF':=EF+(0.1-(5-q)*(0.08+(5-q)*0.02))</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">Note, that for q=4 the E-Factor does not change. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Let us now consider the final form of the SM-2 algorithm
that with minor changes was used in the SuperMemo programs, versions 1.0-3.0 between
December 13, 1987 and March 9, 1989 (the name SM-2 was chosen because of the fact that <a href="https://www.supermemo.com/english/sms.htm">SuperMemo 2.0</a> was by far the most popular version
implementing this algorithm).</font></p>

<p><b><font size="4">Algorithm SM-2 used in the computer-based variant of the
SuperMemo method and involving the calculation of easiness factors for particular items:</font></b></p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li><font size="3">Split the knowledge into smallest possible items.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">With all items associate an E-Factor equal to 2.5.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">Repeat items using the following intervals:<br>
      <strong>I(1):=1<br>
      I(2):=6<br>
      for n&gt;2: I(n):=I(n-1)*EF<br>
      </strong>where:<br>
      I(n) - inter-repetition interval after the n-th repetition (in days),<br>
      EF - E-Factor of a given item<br>
      If interval is a fraction, round it up to the nearest integer.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">After each repetition assess the quality of repetition
      response in 0-5 grade scale:<br>
      5 - perfect response<br>
      4 - correct response after a hesitation<br>
      3 - correct response recalled with serious difficulty<br>
      2 - incorrect response; where the correct one seemed easy to recall<br>
      1 - incorrect response; the correct one remembered<br>
      0 - complete blackout.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">After each repetition modify the E-Factor of the recently
      repeated item according to the formula:<br>
      <strong>EF':=EF+(0.1-(5-q)*(0.08+(5-q)*0.02))<br>
      </strong>where:<br>
      EF' - new value of the E-Factor,<br>
      EF - old value of the E-Factor,<br>
      q - quality of the response in the 0-5 grade scale.<br>
      If EF is less than 1.3 then let EF be 1.3.</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">If the quality response was lower than 3 then start
      repetitions for the item from the beginning without changing the E-Factor (i.e. use
      intervals I(1), I(2) etc. as if the item was memorized anew).</font></li>
    <li><font size="3">After each repetition session of a given day repeat again
      all items that scored below four in the quality assessment. Continue the repetitions until
      all of these items score at least four.</font></li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p><font size="3">The optimization procedure used in finding E-Factors proved
to be very effective. In SuperMemo programs you will always find an option for displaying
the distribution of E-Factors (later called the E-Distribution). The shape of the
E-Distribution in a given database was roughly established within few months since the
outset of repetitions. This means that E-Factors did not change significantly after that
period and it is safe to presume that E-Factors correspond roughly to the real factor by
which the inter-repetition intervals should increase in successive repetitions.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">During the first year of using the SM-2 algorithm (learning
English vocabulary), I memorized 10,255 items. The time required for creating the database
and for repetitions amounted to 41 minutes per day. This corresponds to the acquisition
rate of 270 items/year/min. The overall retention was 89.3%, but after excluding the
recently memorized items (intervals below 3 weeks) which do not exhibit properly
determined E-Factors the retention amounted to 92%. Comparing the SM-0 and SM-2 algorithms
one must consider the fact that in the former case the retention was artificially high
because of hints the student is given while repeating items of a given page. Items
preceding the one in question can easily suggest the correct answer.<br>
Therefore the SM-2 algorithm, though not stunning in terms of quantitative comparisons,
marked the second major improvement of the SuperMemo method after the introduction of the
concept of optimal intervals back in 1985. Separating items previously grouped in pages
and introducing E-Factors were the two major components of the improved algorithm.
Constructed by means of the trial-and-error approach, the SM-2 algorithm proved in
practice the correctness of nearly all basic assumptions that led to its conception</font><font size="2">.</font></p>
